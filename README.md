AutoForensics-AI

An Intelligent Multi-Agent System for Automated Digital Forensics, Network Attack Detection, Threat Intelligence, and Security Analytics

📌 Overview

AutoForensics-AI is a multi-agent cybersecurity and digital forensics system designed to analyze PCAP files, server logs, and other security-relevant data. It automates the entire workflow of forensic investigation—from raw input parsing to attack detection, vulnerability analysis, threat intelligence enrichment, and final dashboard generation.

Built around a modular agent architecture, the system mirrors real enterprise-grade Incident Response (IR) and Security Operations Center (SOC) pipelines. Each agent is responsible for a specialized domain, enabling high-scalability, explainability, and clear separation of responsibilities.

The platform is ideal for:

Security researchers
Incident responders
Digital forensics analysts
SOC teams
Students and cybersecurity educators

Automated threat analysis and AI-based forensic workflows

With AutoForensics-AI, users can upload a PCAP file or log file, and the system automatically processes, analyzes, enriches, and visualizes the intelligence through a live dashboard.

📌 Key Features

Modular Multi-Agent Architecture

PCAP Parsing + Log Parsing Pipelines

Attack Detection Engine

Vulnerability Assessment Engine
Timeline Reconstruction
Threat Intelligence Enrichment
Automated Dashboard Generation
Enterprise-grade analysis workflows

Consistent, extensible architecture suitable for large-scale deployments

📌 Architecture Summary
Below is a structured explanation of the provided architecture diagram.

### 1. User Input Layer
The system begins with a simple user interaction:

Upload a PCAP file or a log file
Trigger auto-analysis

The root agent orchestrates the entire pipeline and delegates tasks across specialized agents.

2. Data Processing Pipeline
Once a file is uploaded, the root agent routes it into the Data Processing Pipeline, which includes:

PCAP Parser Agent

Extracts packets
Identifies protocols, endpoints, ports
Reconstructs flows and sessions
Prepares structured features for downstream analysis

Log Parser Agent

Parses system logs, security event logs, access logs, and application logs
Normalizes timestamps, IPs, events, and metadata
Extracts anomaly-relevant attributes
This stage converts raw unstructured or binary data into structured machine-readable formats.

3. Analysis Pipeline
After data processing, three parallel agents perform deeper analysis:

Attack Detection Agent

Uses rule-based, anomaly-based, or ML-based methods
Detects known attack signatures
Evaluates suspicious patterns
Flags high-risk interactions (e.g., port scans, brute force, data exfiltration attempts)

Vulnerability Agent

Identifies vulnerable services
Highlights insecure configurations
Maps findings to CVE/CWE data
Detects outdated protocols or weak cryptography
Timeline Agent
Reconstructs event sequences
Maps chronological attack/incident progression
Helps analysts understand “what happened and when”
These three agents collectively build a comprehensive forensic view of network or system events.

4. Intelligence Enrichment Pipeline

Insights generated by the analysis agents flow into:
Threat Intelligence Agent
Enriches IPs, domains, hashes, or artifacts
Queries external or internal threat intelligence sources
Maps malicious indicators (IoCs) to known threat actors or campaigns
This enrichment stage transforms raw forensic findings into actionable intelligence—critical for enterprise SOC workflows.

5. Dashboard Pipeline

Finally, analysis results pass into:
Dashboard Generator Agent
Converts structured results into a live visual dashboard
Generates charts, tables, timelines, and summaries
Creates a shareable Live Dashboard URL
The dashboard serves as the final output for:
Incident reports
Executive summaries
SOC monitoring
Classroom demonstrations
Forensic documentation

📌 Key Benefits
✔ Fully Automated
Minimal user input—upload a file and the system handles everything else.

✔ Enterprise-Ready Pipeline
Follows industry forensic and IR (incident response) models.

✔ Modular Agents
Each agent can be replaced, enhanced, or extended.

✔ High Scalability
Supports multiple file types, large PCAPs, and complex enterprise logs.

✔ Forensic Accuracy
Uses structured workflows trusted by cybersecurity professionals.

✔ Dashboard-Driven Output

Perfect for reports and presentations.

📌 Use Cases
Digital Forensics
Automates packet examination, log correlation, and event reconstruction.
SOC Operations
Detects threats, suspicious activity, and vulnerability exposures.
Threat Hunting
Enriched indicators make it easy to track adversary behavior.
Cybersecurity Training
Ideal for students or workshops.
Automated Security Assessments
Hands-free vulnerability Audit + Threat Intelligence + Timeline.
